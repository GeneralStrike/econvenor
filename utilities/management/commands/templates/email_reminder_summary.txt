Hi {{ convenor_name }},

Reminders about the tasks listed below have just been emailed to the people responsible for them.
{% if all_overdue_tasks %}
***Tasks which are overdue***
{% for task in all_overdue_tasks %}
{{ task.description }} (by {{task.participant.first_name}} {{task.participant.last_name}} / due on {{ task.deadline|date:"M j" }})
{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% if all_due_tasks %}
***Tasks due within the next {{ reminder_interval }} days***
{% for task in all_due_tasks %}
{{ task.description }} (by {{task.participant.first_name}} {{task.participant.last_name}} / due on {{ task.deadline|date:"M j" }})
{% endfor %}{% endif %}

=============================================================

eConvenor automatically sends a reminder email to a participant when either:
1) a task assigned to them is recorded as incomplete and becomes due in {{ reminder_interval }} days, or
2) a task assigned to them is recorded as incomplete and becomes overdue.

eConvenor works out when tasks are overdue based on the time in Melbourne, Australia.
