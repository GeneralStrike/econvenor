Hi {{ recipient_name }},

Just a quick reminder about some things you're responsible for doing for {{ group_name }}.
{% if overdue_tasks %}
***Tasks which are overdue***
{% for task in overdue_tasks %}
{{ task.description }} (due on {{ task.deadline|date:"M j" }})
{% endfor %}{% endif %}{% if due_tasks %}
***Tasks due within the next {{ reminder_interval }} days***
{% for task in due_tasks %}
{{ task.description }} (due on {{ task.deadline|date:"M j" }})
{% endfor %}{% endif %}

You may view and update your tasks at the following page (link expires after {{ expiry_days }} days):
{{ participant_task_url }}

=============================================================

eConvenor automatically emails you a reminder like this when either:
1) a task assigned to you is recorded as incomplete and becomes due in {{ reminder_interval }} days, or
2) a task assigned to you is recorded as incomplete and becomes overdue.

eConvenor works out when tasks are overdue based on the time in Melbourne, Australia.
